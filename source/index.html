		<h2>Who's invited?</h2>

			need to be a developer, designer, or even work in the tech industry; you just need to bring your interest and your passions.</p>

		<h2>Channels</h2>
		<p>Slack chat spaces are divided into rooms called "channels", and we have a few. There are three you'll be in by default:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><span class="channel-name">#announcements</span>: occasional announcements</li>
			<li><span class="channel-name">#chat</span>: random chat</li>
			<li><span class="channel-name">#introductions</span>: introduce yourself!</li>
		</ul>
		<p>All rooms are opt-in except #announcements, which is why it is kept low-volume.</p>

		<h2>What are the rules?</h2>
		<p>We have a simple <a href="/code-of-conduct/">Code of Conduct</a> that is based on the same Code of Conduct used by projects
			such as <a href="https://github.com/angular/code-of-conduct" rel="noopener">AngularJS</a>, <a href="https://dotnetfoundation.org/code-of-conduct" rel="noopener">The .NET Foundation</a>,
			<a href="http://rubyonrails.org/conduct/" rel="noopener">Rails</a>, and <a href="https://swift.org/community/#code-of-conduct" rel="noopener">Swift</a>.</p>

		<h2>Community Guidelines</h2>
		<p>In order to help newcomers understand both Slack and our community a bit more, we've documented some basic tips and tricks
			in our <a href="/community-guidelines/">Community Guidelines</a>.</p>
