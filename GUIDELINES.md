# Baton Rouge Slack Community Guidelines

The Baton Rouge Slack community is a collection of people living in the Baton Rouge area who are, in some way, interested and/or involved with technology and design.

## Our Community

This community strives to be a welcoming, fun, informative, and beneficial community to Baton Rouge-area residents who have an interest in technology and design related topics. You don't need to be an experienced programmer or seasoned designer to take part, but you do need to live in the Baton Rouge area.

## Joining and Invitations

To request an invitation, please fill out the form on [brslack.com](https://brslack.com). If you're a member of the community who'd like to invite someone, please send them to the invite request form.

## General Guidelines

1. Conversations in the community are organized around topical channels. You are encouraged to conduct your conversations in the most appropriate channel. It's inevitable that a conversation may veer off-topic, and this is totally acceptable. However, if you find yourself too off-topic, please relocate your conversation to a more appropriate channel.
2. Explicit material (including, but not limited to, pornographic images, discussions of sexual activity, or any other content that would be deemed NSFW) is not acceptable in any channel. Please remember that many participants are using Slack while in a work environment.

## The #announcements Channel

Due to the way Slack works, members cannot leave the #announcements channel. The following guidelines are designed to help keep the noise in this channel to a minimum, while still allowing important messages to reach everyone in the community.

1. The #annoucements channel is not a channel for discussion. If you'd like to discuss a message posted in #announcements, please do so in the appropriate channel.
2. All members are encouraged to create channels that they feel should exist. If you do, please let everyone know by posting a note in the #announcements channel.
3. The #announcements channel is primarily used for announcements regarding the Baton Rouge Slack community, but can also be used to announce local events, news, and other things that members may be interested in. We ask that you use your best judgement when determining whether something is appropriate for #announcements.

## Code of Conduct

The Baton Rouge Slack community adheres to a standard of behavior. Please see our Code of Conduct for more information.
